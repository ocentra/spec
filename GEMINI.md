# Spec System - Gemini Instructions

This file provides Gemini with instructions on how to use the Spec System for project management and development.

## Overview

The Spec System is a comprehensive project management framework that provides structured commands for planning, developing, and maintaining projects. Each command has detailed instructions that should be followed for optimal results.

## Available Commands

**DETAILED REFERENCE**: See `@FILE_INDEX.md` ‚Üí `## üìÅ Core Command Files` and `## üõ†Ô∏è Instruction Files`

**ESSENTIAL COMMANDS**:

- **@start.md** - Start Project (comprehensive setup guidance)
- **@status.md** - Check Status (project status and progress)
- **@update.md** - Update Project (sync code with documentation)
- **@create-spec.md** - Create Specification (feature specifications)
- **@execute-tasks.md** - Execute Tasks (development implementation)
- **@git-management.md** - Git Management (version control)

## How to Use Commands

**DETAILED GUIDE**: See `@FILE_INDEX.md` ‚Üí `## üéØ How to Use This Index`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

1. Check file structure first using `@FILE_INDEX.md`
2. Understand system architecture using `@ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. Identify user's intent and select appropriate command
4. Follow detailed instructions in the specified file
5. Execute step by step carefully

**üö® CRITICAL**: Before executing any development tasks, ensure ALL spec writing is complete.

## File Structure Reference

**DETAILED REFERENCE**: See `@FILE_INDEX.md` ‚Üí `## üìÅ Core Command Files` and `## üõ†Ô∏è Instruction Files`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

- `commands/` - Command entry points and quick references
- `instructions/` - Detailed instructions for each command
- `standards/` - Best practices, code style, and tech stack guidelines
- `config.yml` - Configuration settings

## Important Notes

**DETAILED RULES**: See `@ai-rules.md` ‚Üí `## Core Principles`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

- Always follow the detailed instructions exactly
- Check file structure first using `@FILE_INDEX.md`
- Understand system architecture using `@ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Follow AI rules in `@ai-rules.md`
- Use markdown rules in `@markdown-rules.md`

## üö® CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

### NO PROJECT CODE WRITING UNTIL SPECS ARE COMPLETE

**MANDATORY**: You MUST complete ALL spec-related tasks before writing any project code.

**REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODE:**

1. ‚úÖ Project planning and mission definition
2. ‚úÖ Tech stack analysis and documentation  
3. ‚úÖ Product roadmap creation
4. ‚úÖ Feature specification development
5. ‚úÖ Task breakdown and prioritization
6. ‚úÖ All spec files complete and validated

**BLOCKING RULE**: Do not proceed to code implementation until ALL specs are finalized.

**ENFORCEMENT**: This rule applies to ALL project phases and cannot be bypassed.

### SPEC COMPLETION VERIFICATION [IMPORTANT!]

Before writing any project code, verify:

- [ ] Mission document is complete
- [ ] Tech stack is documented
- [ ] Roadmap is finalized
- [ ] Feature specs are written
- [ ] Tasks are broken down
- [ ] All documentation is validated

**IF ANY SPEC ITEMS ARE INCOMPLETE**: Stop and complete them first.

## Quick Reference

**DETAILED REFERENCE**: See `@FILE_INDEX.md` ‚Üí `## ‚ö° Quick Reference Commands`

**ESSENTIAL COMMANDS**:

- **Start project**: `@start.md`
- **Check status**: `@status.md`
- **Create feature**: `@create-spec.md`
- **Execute tasks**: `@execute-tasks.md`
- **Update project**: `@update.md`

## Error Handling

**DETAILED RULES**: See `@ai-rules.md` ‚Üí `## Error Handling`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

- Check if required files exist
- Verify project structure is correct
- Follow error handling procedures in instruction files
- Ask user for clarification if needed

## Best Practices

**DETAILED RULES**: See `@ai-rules.md` ‚Üí `## Best Practices`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

- Read complete instruction file before proceeding
- Follow step-by-step process outlined in each command
- Maintain consistency with project standards
- Update project memory and logs as instructed
- Provide clear feedback to the user throughout the process

## üö® GEMINI-SPECIFIC WARNINGS

### DO NOT JUMP TO CODE WRITING

**COMMON GEMINI MISTAKE**: Starting to write project code before completing specifications.

**DETAILED RULES**: See `@ai-rules.md` ‚Üí `### üö® When in Doubt, Ask - Don't Assume` (Code Implementation section)

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

- **MANDATORY**: Complete ALL spec writing first
- **VERIFY**: All documentation is finished
- **THEN**: Proceed to code implementation

### üö® SCOPE CREEP AND GIT WORKFLOW WARNINGS

**COMMON GEMINI MISTAKE**: Touching files outside intended scope and not following proper Git workflow.

**DETAILED RULES**:

- Scope Control: See `@execute-tasks.md` ‚Üí `#### üö® Scope Validation and Control`
- Git Workflow: See `@git-management.md` ‚Üí `### üö® AI-Assisted Development Branch Strategy`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

- **SCOPE**: Define exact files to be modified before starting
- **GIT**: Use `@git-management.md` for all Git operations
- **BRANCH**: Use `ai/phase-task-description` naming
- **SYNC**: Pull at natural breakpoints (task completion, end of day)
- **CONFIRMATION**: Get user approval for scope changes

### üö® ASK BEFORE ASSUMING WARNING

**COMMON GEMINI MISTAKE**: Making assumptions when uncertain instead of asking for clarification.

**DETAILED RULES**: See `@ai-rules.md` ‚Üí `### üö® When in Doubt, Ask - Don't Assume`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:

- **CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: If ANY uncertainty exists, STOP and ask for clarification
- **APPLIES TO**: Code implementation, file modifications, configuration choices, design decisions, error handling, scope boundaries, technology choices
- **MANDATORY RULE**: When in doubt, ask - don't assume
