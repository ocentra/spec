# Spec System - Gemini Instructions

This file provides Gemini with instructions on how to use the Spec System for project management and development.

## Overview

The Spec System is a comprehensive project management framework that provides structured commands for planning, developing, and maintaining projects. Each command has detailed instructions that should be followed for optimal results.

## Available Commands

### Core Project Commands

#### @start.md - Start Project

**When to use**: When starting a new project or continuing an existing one
**Purpose**: Comprehensive project analysis and setup guidance
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `start.md` for project setup and analysis

#### @plan-product.md - Plan Product

**When to use**: When planning a new product or feature
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive product documentation and planning
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `instructions/plan-product.md`

#### @analyze-product.md - Analyze Product

**When to use**: When analyzing an existing product or codebase
**Purpose**: Analyze current state and provide improvement recommendations
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `instructions/analyze-product.md`

#### @create-spec.md - Create Specification

**When to use**: When creating detailed feature specifications
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive technical specifications
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `instructions/create-spec.md`

#### @execute-tasks.md - Execute Tasks

**When to use**: When implementing features or working on development tasks
**Purpose**: Execute planned tasks with structured guidance
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `instructions/execute-tasks.md`

### Project Management Commands

#### @status.md - Check Status

**When to use**: When checking current project status and progress
**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive project status reports
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `status.md`

#### @update.md - Update Project

**When to use**: When syncing code with documentation and updating project state
**Purpose**: Update project documentation and identify discrepancies
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `update.md`

#### @phase-orchestrator.md - Phase Orchestrator

**When to use**: When managing project phases and transitions
**Purpose**: Orchestrate project phases and manage transitions
**Instructions**: Follow the detailed instructions in `instructions/phase-orchestrator.md`

## How to Use Commands

1. **Check file structure first**: Use `@FILE_INDEX.md` to understand the complete file structure and optimize token usage
2. **Understand system architecture**: Read `@ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand static instruction patterns and file locations
3. **Identify the user's intent**: Determine what they want to accomplish
4. **Select the appropriate command**: Choose the command that best matches their needs
5. **Follow the detailed instructions**: Each command has comprehensive instructions in the specified file
6. **Execute step by step**: Follow the instructions carefully for best results

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Before executing any development tasks, ensure ALL spec writing is complete.

## File Structure Reference

- `commands/` - Command entry points and quick references
- `instructions/` - Detailed instructions for each command
- `standards/` - Best practices, code style, and tech stack guidelines
- `config.yml` - Configuration settings

**For complete file structure and token optimization**: See `@FILE_INDEX.md`
**For system architecture understanding**: See `@ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Important Notes

- **Always follow the detailed instructions**: Each command has comprehensive instructions that should be followed exactly
- **Check file structure first**: Use `@FILE_INDEX.md` to understand the complete file structure and optimize token usage
- **Understand system architecture**: Read `@ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the static instruction patterns and file locations
- **Follow AI rules**: Always comply with the AI rules in `instructions/ai-rules.md`
- **Use markdown rules**: Follow the markdown formatting rules in `instructions/markdown-rules.md`

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

### NO PROJECT CODE WRITING UNTIL SPECS ARE COMPLETE

**MANDATORY**: You MUST complete ALL spec-related tasks before writing any project code.

**REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODE:**

1. âœ… Project planning and mission definition
2. âœ… Tech stack analysis and documentation  
3. âœ… Product roadmap creation
4. âœ… Feature specification development
5. âœ… Task breakdown and prioritization
6. âœ… All spec files complete and validated

**BLOCKING RULE**: Do not proceed to code implementation until ALL specs are finalized.

**ENFORCEMENT**: This rule applies to ALL project phases and cannot be bypassed.

### SPEC COMPLETION VERIFICATION [IMPORTANT!]

Before writing any project code, verify:

- [ ] Mission document is complete
- [ ] Tech stack is documented
- [ ] Roadmap is finalized
- [ ] Feature specs are written
- [ ] Tasks are broken down
- [ ] All documentation is validated

**IF ANY SPEC ITEMS ARE INCOMPLETE**: Stop and complete them first.

## Quick Reference

| User Intent | Command | Instructions File |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Start new project | @start.md | `start.md` |
| Plan product | @plan-product.md | `instructions/plan-product.md` |
| Analyze existing product | @analyze-product.md | `instructions/analyze-product.md` |
| Create feature spec | @create-spec.md | `instructions/create-spec.md` |
| Execute development tasks | @execute-tasks.md | `instructions/execute-tasks.md` |
| Check project status | @status.md | `status.md` |
| Update project docs | @update.md | `update.md` |
| Manage project phases | @phase-orchestrator.md | `instructions/phase-orchestrator.md` |

## Error Handling

If you encounter issues:

1. Check if the required files exist
2. Verify the project structure is correct
3. Follow the error handling procedures in the instruction files
4. Ask the user for clarification if needed

## Best Practices

- Always read the complete instruction file before proceeding
- Follow the step-by-step process outlined in each command
- Maintain consistency with project standards
- Update project memory and logs as instructed
- Provide clear feedback to the user throughout the process

## ðŸš¨ GEMINI-SPECIFIC WARNINGS

### DO NOT JUMP TO CODE WRITING

**COMMON GEMINI MISTAKE**: Starting to write project code before completing specifications.

**CORRECT BEHAVIOR**:

1. Complete ALL spec writing first
2. Verify all documentation is finished
3. Only then proceed to code implementation

**WRONG BEHAVIOR**:

- Writing code while specs are incomplete
- Skipping documentation to start coding
- Ignoring the spec completion requirement

**REMEMBER**: Spec System enforces "Spec First, Code Second" - this is non-negotiable.
