# Checklist Management System

## Overview

Provides the template and instructions for creating and maintaining a central `checklist.md` file in the project root that provides an always-visible, scannable overview of project status and progress.

> **Architecture Note:** This is a static instruction file. The checklist file is created as `checklist.md` (project root) when this instruction is executed.

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Checklist Creation

#### Creates

File: checklist.md (project root, using the template below)

#### Checklist Template

```markdown
# Project Task Checklist

The checklist tracks the progress of the [PROJECT_NAME] project. Tasks will be marked as `[x]` upon completion by the AI orchestrator.
This checklist needs a timestamp each time this checklist is edited or marked or new task is done or added. Important for tracking progress and maintaining project memory.

- **ACTION**: Ensure checklist is easily accessible
- **REFERENCE**: Include in status reports and memory
- **UPDATE**: Keep prominently visible in project structure

## Error Handling

### Missing Checklist

If checklist.md (project root) doesn't exist:

```markdown
**Action Required**: Create project checklist
**Command**: Run status check to initialize checklist
```

### Outdated Checklist

If checklist is outdated:

```markdown
