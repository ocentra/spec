# Spec System

> **Transform AI coding from chaotic prompting into structured, predictable development**

The Spec system is a **comprehensive, static instruction library** designed to make AI agents work like senior developers on your team. With nearly **70k tokens** of highly detailed, modularized, and task-specific instructions, it provides the context, structure, and workflows that turn AI coding from frustrating trial-and-error into reliable, consistent development.

## üöÄ Why Use Spec System?

Stop wrestling with AI that writes the wrong code. Spec System transforms coding agents from confused assistants into trusted developers who truly understand your codebase and follow your patterns.

### 3 Core Benefits

#### 1. **Complete Context, Not Just Prompts**

Unlike basic AI setups, Spec System provides comprehensive instructions that work together:

- **Standards** - Your coding style, tech stack, and best practices
- **Instructions** - Detailed workflows for every development task
- **Commands** - Simple entry points for AI tools to access the system

**Result**: AI writes code that looks like you wrote it‚Äîfirst time, every time.

#### 2. **Structured Development, Not Chaos**

Spec System replaces random prompting and circular rewrites with a proven workflow. It automatically:

- Writes comprehensive specs before coding begins
- Breaks features into trackable, TDD-focused tasks
- Documents key decisions as they happen
- Updates your roadmap as features ship

**Difference**: Ship features faster with clear specs and completed tasks‚Äînot endless cycles of (re)explaining requirements and redoing work.

#### 3. **Your Standards, Your Way**

Spec System is completely yours to shape. Define your own coding standards, write custom instructions, and adapt every workflow to match how your team operates. No rigid interfaces or prescribed processes‚Äîjust markdown files you control. Works seamlessly with any AI tool or IDE you choose.

**Relief**: Your coding agent finally feels like a senior developer on your team‚Äîthinking your way, following your patterns, and shipping at your standards.

## üîÑ How Spec System Works

Spec System works through a **static instruction library** that AI agents follow. Think of it as a comprehensive rulebook that tells AI exactly how to behave like a senior developer on your team.

It essentially acts as a highly detailed instruction manual or a "senior developer in a box" that enforces a specific, opinionated workflow. The core idea is to move away from chaotic and iterative prompting towards a more disciplined, spec-driven development process.

### Core Principles

- **Static and Reusable Instructions**: The `.spec/` directory contains a library of immutable instructions, standards, and commands that are meant to be read-only for the AI. This ensures consistency across projects.
- **Project-Specific Generation**: For each project, the system generates a `[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/` directory, which holds all the project-specific artifacts like the product mission, roadmap, and decision logs.
- **Spec-Driven Development**: A crucial and heavily enforced rule is that no application code should be written until all specifications are complete. This includes defining the product, technology stack, roadmap, and breaking down features into detailed tasks.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The system automates the creation of a wide range of documentation, from high-level product vision to detailed technical specifications and API schemas.
- **AI-Agnostic with Configuration**: It's designed to work with various AI coding assistants (Cursor, Claude, Gemini) by generating the necessary configuration files to integrate them into the workflow.
- **Phase-Based Orchestration**: The development process is broken down into distinct phases, which are executed sequentially, ensuring that prerequisites are met before moving to the next stage.
- **Memory and Logging**: The system maintains a `project-memory.md` for context and a detailed `ai-log.md` to track all actions, decisions, and errors, providing transparency and auditability.
- **User-Centric Workflow**: While highly automated, the system includes numerous checkpoints for user input, review, and approval, ensuring the final product aligns with the user's vision.

### Development Workflow

#### **Phase 1: Initialization** (`start.md`)
A new or existing project is identified. The system configures the AI assistant and can initiate the planning phase.

#### **Phase 2: Product Planning** (`plan-product.md`)
The user is prompted for the project's vision, key features, target users, and technology stack. This information is used to generate foundational documents like `mission.md`, `roadmap.md`, and `tech-stack.md`.

**Interactive Process**: Spec System doesn't just generate files‚Äîit **interactively guides you** through the entire development process:

```markdown
@plan-product

AI: "What type of project are you building?"
You: "A SaaS tool for customer feedback"

AI: "Who are your target users?"
You: "Product managers at B2B SaaS companies"

AI: "What are your key features?"
You: "Feedback collection, sentiment analysis, reporting dashboard"

AI: "Do you have a preferred tech stack?"
You: "Use my defaults"

AI: "Let me create your project structure..."
```

#### **Phase 3: Specification Creation** (`create-spec.md`)
For each new feature, a detailed specification is created. This includes user stories, scope, technical requirements, and potentially database and API specifications. The output is a set of "sub-spec" documents.

#### **Phase 4: Task Execution** (`execute-tasks.md`)
Once a spec is approved, the work is broken down into a `tasks.md` file. The AI then executes these tasks, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach where tests are often the first sub-task.

#### **Phase 5: Status and Updates** (`status.md`, `update.md`)
The system provides commands to check the current project status and to synchronize the documentation with the actual state of the codebase.

### File Architecture

#### **Static Instructions (Shared Foundation)**

The `.spec/` directory contains a shared instruction library that serves as the foundation for all projects:

- **Commands** - Simple entry points for AI tools (`@start`, `@plan-product`, etc.)
- **Instructions** - Detailed workflows for every development task
- **Standards** - Your coding style, tech stack, and best practices

**Important**: These files are designed as a shared, reusable foundation. Individual projects don't modify these files during development - they're treated as read-only instructions. However, contributors can fork the repository to improve the system or create their own customized versions.

#### **Project-Specific Files (Auto-Generated)**

When you first run `@start` and `@plan-product`, Spec System automatically generates several key files:

**Project Documentation:**
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/product/mission.md`** - Complete product vision with pitch, users, problems, and features
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/product/tech-stack.md`** - Technology choices and configurations
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/product/roadmap.md`** - Development phases and feature timeline
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/product/decisions.md`** - Technical decisions log with rationale
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/product/mission-lite.md`** - Condensed mission for AI context efficiency

**Project Management:**
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/project-memory.md`** - AI's persistent memory and context tracking
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/checklist.md`** - Task completion tracking and progress
- **`[PROJECT_NAME]-spec/ai-log.md`** - Detailed activity log and audit trail

**AI Assistant Configuration:**
- **`.cursor/rules/`** - Cursor IDE configuration files
- **`.claude/`** - Claude Code configuration files  
- **`GEMINI.md`** - Gemini configuration file

#### **What to Expect During Setup**

1. **Interactive Questions**: AI asks about your project vision, features, users, and tech preferences
2. **Smart Defaults**: Uses your existing tech stack preferences when available
3. **Missing Information**: Prompts for any required details not provided
4. **File Generation**: Creates all documentation with your specific project details
5. **AI Integration**: Sets up your preferred AI assistants with Spec command access

### AI Memory & Context Management

#### **Persistent Memory System**

- **`project-memory.md`**: AI remembers every decision, context, and progress
- **`checklist.md`**: Tracks completed tasks and next steps
- **`ai-log.md`**: Records all AI activities and decisions
- **`decisions.md`**: Documents technical choices and rationale

#### **Context Hopping**

AI can seamlessly switch between:

- **Planning**: Review and update roadmap
- **Development**: Execute specific tasks
- **Review**: Check status and progress
- **Debugging**: Analyze issues and solutions

#### **Example Context Switching**

```markdown
# Check current status
@status

# Continue where you left off
@execute-tasks

# Create new feature spec
@create-spec

# Update project documentation
@update
```

### Runtime Integration

Spec System integrates with your existing workflow:

- **AI Tool Configuration** - Creates `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `GEMINI.md` files
- **Project Documentation** - Generates mission, roadmap, and technical specs
- **Development Tracking** - Maintains progress and context across sessions

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
